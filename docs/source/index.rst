   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to RM-Alt's documentation!
==================================
RM-Alt uses a lot of `Rocket Map`_ code but has many additional features such as: auto-removing accounts with shadow bans,
IV scanning enhancements, scanning for Ditto and Discord Authentication to name a few enhancements.

The setting up and installing of RM-Alt is a little different to Rocket Map.  These docs will help explain exactly what
is needed to get RM-Alt running.
